import pandas as pd
 # >> Create a Series
 groceries = pd.Series(data=[30, 20, 150, 13], index=['apples', 'peaches', 'banannas', 'bread'])
 # >> Just like numpy arrays pandas Series have methods
 groceries.size
 groceries.index
 groceries.values
 groceries.ndim
 groceries.shape
 'cocoa' in groceries
 'bread' in groceries
## >> Getting indexes and slicing:
# >>>> Series.iloc[integer index]
groceries.iloc[[1, 3]]
# >>>> Series.loc[string index]
groceries.iloc[['apples', 'bread']]
 # >>> TO elemenate from Series ?Use drop method
 groceries.drop('bread') 
 ### >>> The previous drop is a copy that doesn't affect the original Series, So to make that change use, inplace
 groceries.drop('bread', inplace=True)
